# newsweek_replica

A replica of the Newsweek Main Page

This project consists of building a responsive clone of the Newsweek web site using bootstrap.

In this project:

1. We took a mobile first approach and started styling for the smallest screen size
2. We used mainly bootstrap classes instead of pure css.
